### Project Title
Udacity Bike-share project from Patrick Deege

### Description
This project enables users to analyse bike-share data from three different US cities.
The code returns some analysis, taking the users input into account, and also allows to see some raw data of the bike-share data.

### Files used
* CSV files
  * chicago.csv
  * washington.csv
  * new_york_city.csv
* bikeshare.py
* README.md

### Credits
I've used two sources:
* Udacity itself
* stackoverflow

I've found some interesting discussions in the Udacity knowledge base and did some research on stackoverflow for certain code snippets around raw user input.
